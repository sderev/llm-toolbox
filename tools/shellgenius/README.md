# [ShellGenius](https://github.com/sderev/shellgenius)

ShellGenius is an intuitive CLI tool designed to enhance your command-line experience by turning your task descriptions into efficient shell commands. It generates accurate commands based on your input and provides step-by-step explanations to help you understand the underlying logic.

ShellGenius shines even more when you create a very short and practical alias for it. I recommend using `??` as its alias. You can find detailed instructions on [its dedicated repository](https://github.com/sderev/shellgenius)
